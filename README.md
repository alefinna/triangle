# triangle
This is a solution for the triangle coordinates problem.

Few notes:
    It's written in .Net Core(version 2.0) using C#.
    It can be run in .Net as well as using Visual Studio Code (with appropriate installation of the framework)
    It's a complied console application. Few test results can be seen by running the main project on the console window.
    For detail comments of specific methods and implementation, please refer the interfaces and classes / methods.
    I tried my best for the classes, methods, and variables to document themselves but I also added a brief comment in places where I thought I needed clarity, decisions and assumptions.
    
Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope to get some response and feedback soon.
